The github repository of the paper "[Noise Transfer for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation of Retinal OCT Images](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16434-7_67)" that was accepted at MICCAI 2022.

We provide a sample [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SO57y3u4JxGkltChlX6kVAnGLLYeRev0#scrollTo=Y8d3_BPrBjW0) where you can try out the SVDNA style transfer yourself, datasets to test style transfer can be requested at the [page of the RETOUCH challange](https://retouch.grand-challenge.org/), one public dataset is available to download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/farsiu-2014). 
The code used to train our model will be released soon.
